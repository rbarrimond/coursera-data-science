# My Coursera Work in Data Science

The repo contains my course work over several months of courses I took to earn my [IBM Data Science Specialization certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/KEYR84KTYSW5). Each folder contains the work for each course out of the ten I took where coding was requireed.
